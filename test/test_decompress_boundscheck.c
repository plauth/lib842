/* Test for regression present in the original software decompressor
   implementation in the Linux Kernel (https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/6/5/727),
   which also formerly affected our implementations. Description:

   The software 842 decompressor receives, through the initial value of the
   'olen' parameter, the capacity of the buffer pointed to by 'out'. If this
   capacity is insufficient to decode the compressed bitstream, -ENOSPC
   should be returned.

   However, the bounds checks are missing for index references (for those
   ops. where decomp_ops includes a I2, I4 or I8 subop.), and also for
   OP_SHORT_DATA. Due to this, sw842_decompress can write past the capacity
   of the 'out' buffer.

   The case for index references can be triggered by compressing data that
   follows a 16-byte periodic pattern (excluding special cases which are
   better encoded by OP_ZEROS) and passing a 'olen' somewhat smaller than the
   original length.
   The case for OP_SHORT_DATA can be triggered by compressing an amount of
   data that is not a multiple of 8, and then a slightly smaller 'olen' that
   can't fit those last <8 bytes.
